Changes in version 1.12:

Clzip now reports an error if a file name is empty (clzip -t "").

Option '-o, --output' now behaves like '-c, --stdout', but sending the
output unconditionally to a file instead of to standard output. See the new
description of '-o' in the manual. This change is backwards compatible only
when (de)compressing from standard input alone. Therefore commands like:
  clzip -o foo.lz - bar < foo
must now be split into:
  clzip -o foo.lz - < foo
  clzip bar
or rewritten as:
  clzip - bar < foo > foo.lz

When using '-c' or '-o', clzip now checks whether the output is a terminal
only once.

Clzip now does not even open the output file if the input file is a terminal.

The words 'decompressed' and 'compressed' have been replaced with the
shorter 'out' and 'in' in the verbose output when decompressing or testing.

Option '--list' now reports corruption or truncation of the last header in a
multimenber file specifically instead of showing the generic message "Last
member in input file is truncated or corrupt."

The commands needed to extract files from a tar.lz archive have been
documented in the manual, in the output of '--help', and in the man page.

Plzip and tarlz are mentioned in the manual as alternatives for
multiprocessors.

Several fixes and improvements have been made to the manual.

9 new test files have been added to the testsuite.
